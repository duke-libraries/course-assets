<p>This setting will determine who can view your file, and the associated metadata. Setting
  the visibility to <span class='label label-success'>Unrestricted</span> will allow your
  content to be viewed by any user, regardless of whether they are logged in or not. The visibility setting
  <span class='label label-info'>Login Required</span> will only allow
  users who are logged into <%=t('sufia.product_name') %> to view the content.
  Files that are marked <span class='label label-danger'>Restricted</span> are only able to be viewed
  by users that have been given specific access in the &quot;Share With&quot; section.
</p>

<p>
  Permissions in <%=t('sufia.product_name') %> are hierarchical. This means that you cannot set
  the visibility of a file to <span class='label label-success'>Unrestricted</span> or
  <span class='label label-info'>Login Required</span> and simultaneously
  try to restrict the access of a single user. However, you may mark the visibility of
  a file as <span class='label label-danger'>Restricted</span> and then grant access to
  particular users for that file in the &quot;Share With&quot; section.
